# üîê SSH Config Tips

A lightweight place to keep quick notes and tips I often forget.  
This one‚Äôs about managing multiple SSH keys and GitHub accounts efficiently.

---

## üß≠ Overview

When you have more than one GitHub account or deploy key,  
you can tell SSH which key to use for each host by editing `~/.ssh/config`.

This prevents "Permission denied" or "wrong account" errors when pushing or pulling.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example Configuration

```sshconfig
# ~/.ssh/config

# Default GitHub (personal)
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal

# Work GitHub (custom alias)
Host github-work
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
```

### üí° Tips  
- Host can be any name ‚Äî it‚Äôs like a nickname for that connection.
- You can have multiple entries, one per identity.
- File permissions matter:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_*
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/*.pub
```

## üß© How to Use a Custom Host in Git

After adding the custom host (github-work),
update your repository‚Äôs remote URL:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github-work:yourname/repo.git
```

Then test it:

```bash

ssh -T git@github-work

```

Expected output:

```bash
Hi yourname! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

## üß† Notes

| What                   | Command / Path               | Description                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| SSH config file        | `~/.ssh/config`              | Defines which key is used for which host |
| List active identities | `ssh-add -l`                 | Shows keys loaded into the SSH agent     |
| Add a key to agent     | `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work` | Temporary for this session               |
| Remove all keys        | `ssh-add -D`                 | Clears agent cache                       |

## ü™Ñ Troubleshooting

| Symptom                              | Possible Fix                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Permission denied (publickey)`      | Check file permissions (`chmod 600`), or ensure the right key is in use |
| GitHub connects to the wrong account | Verify `Host` name and remote URL (`git remote -v`)                     |
| SSH config ignored                   | Ensure file is named exactly `config` (no extension)                    |
| `ssh -T git@github-work` fails       | Try `ssh -vT git@github-work` for verbose output                        |

## ‚úÖ Quick Recap

- Define multiple keys in ~/.ssh/config
- Use a custom Host alias (like github-work)
- Point your repo‚Äôs remote to git@<alias>:user/repo.git
- Test with ssh -T
